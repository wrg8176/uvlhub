"""End-to-end browser tests for the notepad feature.

Driven by the selenium grid started by::

    docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.dev.yml up

Run with::

    rosemary test notepad --e2e

The driver comes from ``tests/selenium_support``, not from
``splent_framework.selenium.common``. The framework helper builds a local
Chrome through webdriver_manager, and there is no browser inside
web_app_container, so it cannot reach the grid. See that module's docstring.

These tests run against the live application and the seeded development
database, not the test database. There is no fixture and no reset between
tests, so keep them read-only or clean up after yourself.
